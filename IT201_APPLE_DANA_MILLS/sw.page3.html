	  The Making of the Apple I was a collaberation between Steve Wozniack and Steve Jobs. 
      Steve Wozniak ( "The Woz"), was responsible for most of the design and innovations of the Apple I 
      computer. Steve Jobs was more into marketinfg the product and getting features on to the prototype.
	  While working at HP ( Hewlett Packard) Wozniack came up with the idea for a pre-assembled 
      circuit board, and did some actual assembly at the HP labs after hours. The team assembled the 
      circiut boards at theier homes ,a nd at the end phase put the reamining parts together in their garage.
      Hence the story about building computers from the garage.

                 <u>The specifications were:</u>
<UL>
            <LI>  BASIC Language ( after hearing about Bill Gates's Altair)
            <LI>  30 Chips
            <LI>  MOS Technology 6502 processor( Language was created by Wozniak himself)
            <LI>  DRAM ( dynamic random access memory)
            <LI>  Intel Chips ( samples  form Steve Jobs)
            <LI>  re-design from fewer chips to a smallest board= fewer connections ( less chance for trouble)
            <LI>  2 - 256 bytes of data 
            <LI>  Keyboard Interface- ASCII-encoded
            <LI>  firmware =PROMs( programmable read only memmory)
            <LI>  sockets (today's slot for expansion, offered flexiblity, and need to hard solder)
            <LI>  16 pin 4K dynamic memmory chips ( 8K bytes in 16 chips)
            <LI>  expandable to 65K
            <LI>  cassette board( to load programs,write programs)
                                                        (Woznizk, 2006)</LI></UL>
